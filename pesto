<center>THE PESTO MANIFESTO: <br>Peter Nowogrodzki
<p>This is the pesto manifesto; an improvised recipe of sorts.<br>When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Must use pine nuts.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. No food processing allowed.<br><br><br>
These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity!
Or should it?
<br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Become inspired by mediocre productions.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Don’t covert production and  experimentation recipe.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Always leave the edges rough, so that  someone can cut themselves.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Take the knife to cultural icons and  produce: produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe;  pun and play, annihilate and resurrect meaning.<br><br><br>
Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.<br><br><br>
